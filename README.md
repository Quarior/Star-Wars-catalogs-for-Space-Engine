Look here: https://github.com/Quarior/Star-Wars-catalogs-for-Space-Engine-Backup

### Where I can find ships/models from the Star Wars universe?
Here is only for catalogs, not ships or models. You can find find other mods in this thread: https://forum.spaceengine.org/viewtopic.php?t=159

### I can't find Alderaan or any world destroyed, it is normal?
By default, all worlds destroyed in the series from Star Wars like Alderaan are be remove or change like a asteroid belt.

If you want to see the world in question, go to catalogs/planets (or open the pak file and go to catalogs/planets), and disable the change made by change the extension (rename .sc to .nosc).

By example, to see Alderaan planet, rename StarWars_Core_Alderaan_Alderaan_fragment.sc to StarWars_Core_Alderaan_Alderaan_fragment.nosc.

### How I can open/edit a pak file ?
A pak file is a special compressed file for Space Engine. It is like a zip file. You can rename pak to zip and after the change, rename zip to pak. Or you can simply use 7-Zip (free: https://www.7-zip.org/) or similar, so you only open the file without edit the extension to made change.
